## Features

- Generate a new Solana keypair
- Request an airdrop on the Solana Devnet
- Send SOL to another public key

## Installation

### Prerequisites

## Usage

### Generate a New Keypair

To generate a new Solana keypair:

```bash
rksol generate
```

This will generate a new keypair and save it to keypair.json in the current directory. The public key will be displayed in the console.

### Request an Airdrop
To request an airdrop of 1 SOL on the Solana Devnet:

```bash
rksol airdrop <publicKey>
```

Replace <publicKey> with the public key for which you want to request an airdrop.

### Send SOL
To send SOL to another public key:

```bash
rksol send <recipientPublicKey> <amount>
```
Replace <recipientPublicKey> with the recipient's public key and <amount> with the amount of SOL to send.
